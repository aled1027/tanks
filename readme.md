### Tanks ###

This is a 2-d game of tanks that is 60-80% finished. Most of the core code is there; all that needs to be done is actually implementing the game. I was originally thinking of 1-player challenge levels, where players have to hit targets and avoid being hit by computer-controlled turrets - similar to the challenges in super smash bros melee where you need to hit all of the targets. 

Given the classes I created and helper classes (namely Point, Vector - see utils for documentation), it should be pretty simple to create any kind of simple game.
